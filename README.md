# Mobile Vim Setup
My own mobile easy-to-setup vim editor.

**The ultimate goal of this project is to create a standalone vim editor with nice plugins pre-configured and can be ready to go with one line: **

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Soooda/.vim
```

Or even on some tough environments that don't even have essential executables!

For instance, [A-Shell](https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell) on IOS:
